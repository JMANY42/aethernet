Input Data
API Link: The base url for the API is at https://hackutd2025.eog.systems/ and the link below will detail all the endpoints that can be used to obtain data. The main ones are api/Data and api/Tickets!
List of Cauldrons: Each cauldron has a unique ID, a name, a latitude/longitude, and a maximum storage volume.
Potion Network Map: Includes all cauldrons as nodes with their locations, and edges representing broomstick travel paths with travel times. The map also contains the Enchanted Market. This map is used to find an optimized schedule for the witches to ensure no cauldron ever overflows, accounting for the travel time between cauldrons and to the Enchanted Market.
Potion Transport Tickets: Tickets are received at the end of each day and contain only a date. Each ticket records the amount of potion collected and transported. These can be obtained from the API at https://hackutd2025.eog.systems/api/Tickets.
Cauldron Level Data: Minute-by-minute potion volumes for each cauldron, covering approximately one week. This data shows how potion levels change over time, including the effects of continuous filling and periodic draining. This can be obtained from the API using https://hackutd2025.eog.systems/api/Data/?start_date=0&end_date=2000000000.

Expected Output 🎯
Visualization of the Potion Network: A map displaying all cauldrons, potion levels, and the sales point.
Historic Data Playback: Ability to review historical potion levels and transport ticket activity.
Discrepancy Detection: Since tickets arrive at the end of the day with only dates (no timestamps), you must match tickets to the actual drain events that occurred during that day. Verify that the volumes on the tickets match the drains for that day by comparing ticket volumes (which include level change + potion generated during drain) to the actual drain events recorded in the historical data. Identify any tickets that appear to have transported more or less than what left the cauldron, highlighting potential unlogged potion drains or discrepancies.
Dynamic Ticket Matching: Your dashboard must implement a robust ticket matching algorithm that works dynamically with changing data. The ticket data provided via the API may change during judging, but your system should still correctly identify which tickets are valid and which are suspicious.

Things to Keep in Mind 🤔
Per-Cauldron Rates: Each cauldron has its own unique fill rate and drain rate, which can differ significantly between cauldrons. These rates determine how quickly potion accumulates and how quickly it can be collected.
Continuous Potion Flow During Drainage: While potion is being drained from a cauldron, more potion continues to accumulate into the tank at the cauldron's fill rate. The total drain volumes should reflect this.
Unload Time: Witches take 15 minutes to unload each time they arrive at the market. This must be accounted for when scheduling trips.

Bonus Output 🌟🥇
Optimized Courier Routes & Forecasting: Using the potion network map, determine what is the minimum number of witches that can run the whole operation. Predict cauldron fill levels and generate efficient courier routes that prevent overflow while accounting for all these factors. Create an optimal schedule for the minimum number of witches required to maintain the entire operation. Visualize these routes on the map to ensure timely deliveries and prevent cauldron overflow.
